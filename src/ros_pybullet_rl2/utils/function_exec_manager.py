"""
Imagine you have to run multiple functions within a deadline.
Running them sequentially will be the easiest thing to do, but if one of them behaves badly
and takes too much time, we are in trouble...
This code, instead of runing functions sequentially, we run them all on separate threads in parallel.
This allows us to consistently call (in time) the functions that meet their deadline, while
ignoring those functions that miss the cycle rate, yet still call them at their maximum rate.
Example:
             plugin1       plugin2         plugin3
start    ----------------------------------------------
              start        start           start
                
              finish
                
                                           finish
loop rate ----------------------------------------------  (deadline)
              start again  start again
                                           finish
                                           start again
                                        .
                                        .
                                        . etc...
  In this example plugin1 and 2 meet their deadline (and therefore are "in time"),
  while plugin3 takes more time than the desired call frequency (misses the loop rate), yet
  it is still being called as fast as it can make its computation.
See function_exec_manager_example.py for a runing example on how to use this class
